# Typescript Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems
in software design

Three main groups of patterns with implementation examples are described here:

## Creational patterns:

(Provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code)

- Factory Method
- Singleton
- Prototype
- Builder

## Structural patterns:

(explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient)

- Bridge
- Facade
- Adapter
- Proxy
- Composite

## Behavioral patterns:

(take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects)

- Chain of Command
- Mediator
- Command
- State
- Strategy
- Iterator
- Template Method
- Observer
